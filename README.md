# ðŸ§  AI News Summarizer and Sentiment Analyzer

A Python Flask web application that extracts, summarizes, and analyzes news articles using AI-powered natural language processing.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Article Extraction**: Automatically extracts article content from any URL using newspaper3k
- **AI-Powered Summarization**: Uses Hugging Face's BART transformer model for intelligent text summarization
- **Dual Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes sentiment using both TextBlob and VADER for comprehensive insights
- **Keyword Extraction**: Identifies the most important keywords from articles
- **Word Count Comparison**: Shows original and summarized word counts with compression ratio
- **Responsive UI**: Modern, mobile-friendly interface built with Bootstrap
- **Error Handling**: Robust handling of invalid or unreachable URLs
- **Request Logging**: Logs all user requests for analytics

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sonal-Jaiswal/Ai-news-Summariser.git
cd Ai-news-Summariser
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Download required NLTK data for TextBlob (run in Python):
```python
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('brown'); nltk.download('punkt')"
```

### Running the Application

1. Start the Flask application:
```bash
python app.py
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

3. Enter a news article URL and click "Analyze Article"

4. View the results:
   - Article title
   - AI-generated summary
   - Sentiment classification (Positive/Negative/Neutral)
   - Polarity score (-1 to 1)
   - Subjectivity score (0 to 1)
   - Compression ratio

## How It Works

1. **URL Validation**: Validates the provided URL format
2. **Article Extraction**: Uses newspaper3k to download and parse the article
3. **Text Summarization**: Processes the article text through BART transformer model
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the text using TextBlob to determine sentiment polarity
5. **Results Display**: Shows summary and sentiment analysis on a beautiful web interface

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Web framework
- **newspaper3k**: Article extraction and parsing
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)**: BART model for summarization
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework for transformers
- **TextBlob**: Sentiment analysis
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend interface

## Error Handling

The application handles various error scenarios:
- Invalid URL formats
- Unreachable URLs
- Articles with insufficient text
- Network errors
- Model loading failures

## Example URLs to Test

- BBC News: https://www.bbc.com/news
- CNN: https://www.cnn.com
- Reuters: https://www.reuters.com
- The Guardian: https://www.theguardian.com

## ðŸš€ Deployment

This application can be deployed to various platforms. Here are instructions for common deployment options:

### Deploy to Heroku

1. Install the Heroku CLI and login:
```bash
heroku login
```

2. Create a new Heroku app:
```bash
heroku create your-app-name
```

3. Create a `Procfile` in the project root:
```
web: python app.py
```

4. Update `app.py` to use the PORT environment variable (change the last line):
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 5000))
    app.run(debug=False, host='0.0.0.0', port=port)
```

5. Deploy to Heroku:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Heroku deployment"
git push heroku main
```

6. Open your deployed app:
```bash
heroku open
```

### Deploy to Railway

1. Sign up at [Railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "New Project" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Select your repository
4. Railway will automatically detect the Python app and deploy it
5. Add environment variables if needed in the Railway dashboard

### Deploy to Render

1. Sign up at [Render.com](https://render.com)
2. Click "New +" â†’ "Web Service"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Configure the service:
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command**: `python app.py`
5. Click "Create Web Service"

### Deploy to PythonAnywhere

1. Sign up at [PythonAnywhere.com](https://www.pythonanywhere.com)
2. Upload your project files or clone from GitHub
3. Create a new web app with Python 3.8+
4. Install dependencies in a virtual environment:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Configure the WSGI file to point to your Flask app
6. Reload the web app

### Deploy to Google Cloud Platform (Cloud Run)

1. Install Google Cloud SDK and login
2. Create a `Dockerfile`:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

3. Build and deploy:
```bash
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/PROJECT-ID/ai-news-summarizer
gcloud run deploy --image gcr.io/PROJECT-ID/ai-news-summarizer --platform managed
```

### Deploy to AWS (Elastic Beanstalk)

1. Install AWS CLI and EB CLI
2. Initialize Elastic Beanstalk:
```bash
eb init -p python-3.8 ai-news-summarizer
```

3. Create an environment and deploy:
```bash
eb create ai-news-env
eb deploy
```

4. Open the application:
```bash
eb open
```

### Important Notes for Production Deployment

- Set `debug=False` in production
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Consider using gunicorn or uWSGI as WSGI server instead of Flask's development server
- For better performance with large models, use a deployment with sufficient RAM (at least 2GB)
- First model download may take time; consider pre-downloading models in your deployment setup
